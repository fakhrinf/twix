# Twix

__<span style="color: rgb(180,0,0);">Twix</span>__ is a lightweight JavaScript library for making AJAX requests in places where jQuery won't go.

### ★ Don't let its tiny size deceive you ★

It may weigh-in at just over 1KB, but this puppy has teeth. __WOOF!__ 

Modelled after the ubiquitious jQuery's AJAX methods (_$.ajax_, _$.get_,_$.post_,_$.patch,_$.put_, _$.delete_ and _$.options_), you can use this in places were jQuery will not load, such as __inside a WebWorker__<sup>#</sup>. You little ripper!

You may be like me and occasionally think that loading the entire jQuery library (about 80KB minified) just to make an AJAX call is just like filling a thimble using a fire hydrant. __<span style="color: rgb(180,0,0);">Twix</span>__ is written from the ground up to work in modern browsers (IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc. Anything that supports __XMLHttpRequest__, really) and has just enough magic sauce to get the job done. No more, no less. 

---

<sup>#</sup> Actually, providing a simple way to make make AJAX calls inside a WebWorker was the primary use-case when developing this golden nugget. How about that.

## Usage 

Simply add a reference to __twix.js__ or __twix.min.js__ and you're good to go. 

> &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="twix.min.js">&lt;/script>

If you want to make an AJAX call from within a WebWorker, load the __<span style="color: rgb(180,0,0);">Twix</span>__ library using the __importScripts__ function:

> importScripts("twix.min.js");

Making an AJAX request is as simple as calling __Twix.ajax(...)__ or __Twix.get(...)__ or __Twix.post(...)__. If typing the four characters of __Twix__ is too much, you use the optional double-underscore (*__.ajax(...)*) shortcut. 

There's an _ultra-basic_ sample of making a GET request from a WebWorker in the [__sample__](http://github.com/neilco/twix/sample/) directory.
